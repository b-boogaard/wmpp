Compiler Design, Dr. Warren Macevoy, Fall 2013
Start date: Oct. 23, 2013

Compiler for WM++ like language written in Ruby that compiles to JVM Bytecode through Jasmin.
Based on work by Dr. Warren Macevoy in C++.

Rake Tasks
task :default - Builds everything in wmpp/ putting .j in j/ and .class in bin/
task :clean - Cleans project
task :build, [:file] - Compiles specific file. Must be given complete file path from Rake default directory
task :run, [:argv] - Runs a .class file in the bin directory i.e. rake run[test] will run test.class
task :tests - Complete test suite
task :brian_test - Tests written by Brian
task :sam_test - Tests written by Sam
task :calc - Starts the repl

WMPP Syntax
All expressions must be fully parenthesized
example:
	(1+1)
	(2*10)
	(3+(2+4))
	(1<10)
	
WMPP can handle both integers and floating points. 
Floating points do not need to start with 0 i.e. .2 and 0.2 are both valid

Assignments do not need to be parenthesized. They can be on either side of an expression
example:
	x=(1+1)
	y=(x+x)
	
Control Structures
example:
	if(x<3)
	expressions
	endif
	
	while(x=(x+2)<10)
	x=(x+1)
	endwhile
